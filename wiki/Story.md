# Story & Themes

You awaken **dead**, in a limbo forest beneath a colossal tree. Across the world, scattered **scraps of paper** reveal fragments of your life. Each memory exposes a **sin** you committed, aligning with the S.A.L.I.G.I.A. cycle.

## Themes
- **Identity & Accountability** — memories confront your past actions.  
- **Duality** — every domain has a Heaven/Hell reflection.  
- **Power vs. Consequence** — absorbing power changes you.

## Endgame Twist
The final boss **SALIGIA** looks like you — a manifestation of yourself. At the end you choose to **rule Heaven**, **rule Hell**, or **escape** back to life (at a cost).
